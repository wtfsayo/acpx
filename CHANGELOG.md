Repo: https://github.com/openclaw/acpx

## Unreleased

### Changes

- Agents/built-ins: add Devin CLI through its native `devin acp` server, forwarding `acpx --model` to the adapter's startup `--model` flag while keeping the scoped Windsurf client-identity compatibility shim.

### Breaking

### Fixes

## 0.15.1 - 2026-09-07

**Highlights:** Hosts can bound terminal output retention without changing existing defaults; incoming ACP messages now default to a 64 MiB limit with an explicit override.

- ACP/terminal: add an opt-in `ACPX_TERMINAL_MAX_OUTPUT_BYTES` ceiling for combined stdout and stderr retention, preserving agent-requested limits and the 64 KiB default unless configured. Zero disables only the host ceiling; truncated output retains the newest UTF-8 suffix. Thanks @SebTardif.
- ACP/transport (**compatibility change**): default incoming messages to a 64 MiB raw-byte limit instead of unlimited input; use `ACPX_MAX_ACP_MESSAGE_BYTES` to raise the limit or `0` to disable it. Overflow errors explain the override, and existing warm owners retain their startup setting.

## 0.15.0 - 2026-09-07

**Highlights:** Embedding hosts gain process lifecycle admission and transient child environments; optional limits bound shell output and ACP/queue input.

- Runtime/embedding: expose optional correlated process lifecycle hooks with awaited launch admission and best-effort failure and exit observers. Thanks @MertBasar0.
- Runtime/embedding: add a snapshotted child-only environment overlay for probes and session reconnects without persisting host settings or overriding protected authentication. Thanks @taras and @coding-ax.
- ACP/results: preserve optional opaque prompt-response metadata in direct, queued, compare, and embedded-runtime results. Thanks @superbiche.
- Agents/built-ins: add MiniMax Code through its native `mcode acp` server, with structured launch arguments and setup/lifecycle guidance. Thanks @hetaoBackend.
- Flows: add optional per-stream shell capture limits with UTF-8 byte accounting and complete process-tree cleanup, retaining unlimited capture by default. Thanks @SebTardif.
- ACP/transport: add an optional raw-byte message limit with clear overflow errors, preserving unlimited input by default and consistent handling across chunk boundaries. Thanks @SebTardif.
- Queue: add an optional incoming request limit with client-side size diagnostics and raw-peer rejection, preserving large requests by default. Thanks @SebTardif.

## 0.14.0 - 2026-09-05

**Highlights:** One-shot runs can apply ACP configuration options before prompting, and embedded clients can wait for the actual prompt transport write.

- CLI/exec: apply repeatable ACP `--config-option <key=value>` selections after the requested model and before a one-shot prompt. Thanks @superbiche.
- Runtime/embedding: settle `promptStarted` only after the exact prompt request is accepted by the writable ACP transport, and reject it when that write fails. Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Flows: preserve unlimited shell timeouts while enclosing deadlines and interrupts cancel active shell commands and attributable descendants before completing, and prevent late executors from launching after cancellation. Thanks @SebTardif.
- ACP/terminal: time out hung Windows `taskkill` and report incomplete cleanup instead of hanging release or reporting a successful kill, retaining terminal state for a cleanup retry. Thanks @SebTardif.
- Runtime/sessions: preserve uppercase and mixed-case environment variable names when saving and reloading session options. Thanks @coding-ax.
- Flows: keep the host alive when a shell action closes stdin before consuming its input. Thanks @SebTardif.
- ACP/terminal: handle child stdout and stderr errors without terminating the host, so wait and release can finish. Thanks @SebTardif.
- ACP/launch: preserve process-spawn `ENOENT` as additive `AGENT_SPAWN_ENOENT` detail and include qualified remediation while keeping the broad runtime code and other spawn failures unchanged. Fixes #510. Thanks @anyech.
- Flows: coalesce heartbeat writes while storage is busy so slow filesystems do not accumulate overlapping writes and stall running steps.
- Dependencies: refresh tsx, zod, qs, replay-viewer packages, React DOM types, and source tooling; align source builds with pnpm 11.25.0 and tsdown 0.23.0. Thanks @dependabot.
- Source builds: document supported Node versions separately from the published CLI runtime minimum; tsdown no longer supports Node 25.

## 2026.8.28 (v0.13.2)

### Changes

- Dependencies: update the ACP SDK, TypeScript runner, replay-viewer dependencies, and validation tooling, and refresh transitive dependency overrides.

### Breaking

### Fixes

- Docs/JSON: fix raw ACP tool-call pipelines and message examples so automation reads nested session updates and handles partial tool updates. Fixes #520. Thanks @prateek.
- Session controls: restore saved model/config selections after reconnect, keep reasoning effort aligned with accepted model changes, and return accepted configuration to embedded clients without pinning unselected defaults. Thanks @programmerlapar.

## 2026.8.18 (v0.13.1)

### Changes

- Docs/readme: rewrite the project front door to the house standard and route detailed CLI guidance to the existing documentation.

- Runtime/embedding: expose the existing per-tool permission policy through
  `AcpRuntimeOptions` so embedded clients can reuse its rule matching and
  decisions. Thanks @xenaocx-dev.

- Runtime/embedding: add turn-scoped ACP form and URL elicitation handlers with capability and cancellation fencing.

### Breaking

- Runtime API: require `AcpRuntimeTurn.promptStarted`, which settles after `connection.prompt()` returns its request promise or fails beforehand.

### Fixes

- Runtime/embedding: settle turn results only after lifecycle persistence and client cleanup attempts finish, including unexpected finalization failures.
- Replay viewer: contain manifest-selected projection reads within their run bundle, including symlink targets. Thanks @bunlongheng.
- CLI/session: re-apply a session-pinned model before set_mode/set_model/set_config_option after reconnect, matching the prompt path so model-dependent options work. Fixes #489. Thanks @SebTardif.
- Runtime: preserve non-empty `messageId` and a safe subset of ACP update `_meta` on `text_delta` events so consumers can distinguish model prose from adapter diagnostics that still use `agent_message_chunk`. Thanks @SebTardif.
- Runtime/sessions: keep atomic-write temporary filenames within filesystem component limits when valid session IDs have long basenames. Thanks @henkterharmsel.
- Runtime/embedding: snapshot permission policies at client configuration boundaries so caller-side mutation cannot change an in-flight turn after prompt readiness.
- Replay viewer: return the same not-found response for missing files and containment-denied paths, preventing outside-target existence probes.
- Runtime/sessions: surface checkpoint flush and session-store save failures during turn finalization instead of dropping them. Thanks @SebTardif.
- ACP/terminal: time out hung `ps` / PowerShell process-list helpers after a shell-backed terminal exits so wait_for_exit, kill, and release can finish. Thanks @SebTardif.
- ACP/terminal: raise the process-list helper stdout cap above execFile's 1 MiB default so large `ps` listings are not dropped as empty. Thanks @SebTardif.
- Runtime/embedding: retain one-shot session ownership from initialization through its turn so repeated pre-turn `ensureSession` calls reuse one backend session, then clean it up after completion. Fixes #504. Thanks @jhgaylor.
- Runtime/embedding: project and persist `session/update` notifications for the full lifetime of retained sessions, including idle periods before and between turns. Fixes #477. Thanks @nyl199310.

## 2026.7.27 (v0.13.0)

### Highlights

- Windows agent launches now use structured argv end to end. Unambiguous legacy `command` plus `args` entries migrate automatically; ambiguous/raw commands and `.sh` wrappers must move to `agents.<name>.argv`, and existing saved custom-agent sessions without argv must be recreated.
- Built-in Pool and ZeroClaw support makes both native ACP stdio servers available without custom registry configuration.
- The new `--no-fs` flag lets compatible agents use their native filesystem implementation instead of ACP client filesystem methods.
- The dependency and pnpm refresh resolves all four known PostCSS, fast-uri, js-yaml, and brace-expansion advisories.

### Changes

- Agents/built-ins: add Pool via `pool acp`. Thanks @dan-roberts-poolside and @osolmaz.

- Agents/built-ins: add ZeroClaw via `zeroclaw acp`, ZeroClaw's native ACP v1 stdio server. Thanks @JordanTheJet.

- CLI/ACP: add `--no-fs` to disable advertised ACP file read/write capabilities so compatible agents can use their native filesystem implementation. Thanks @zgxkbtl.

- CLI/timers: preserve tiny positive timeout and TTL values from flags or config as 1 ms instead of disabling timers, and reject delays beyond Node's supported timer range. Thanks @realmehmetali.

- Dependencies/tooling: refresh the ACP SDK, runtime and development toolchain, update pnpm to 10.34.5, and resolve the PostCSS, fast-uri, js-yaml, and brace-expansion advisories.

### Breaking

- Windows agent launches now require structured `agents.<name>.argv`; unambiguous legacy `command` plus `args` entries migrate automatically, while raw, ambiguous, or directly executable `.sh` commands fail with explicit migration guidance instead of lossy parsing or CreateProcess ENOENT. Existing custom-agent sessions without saved argv must be recreated. Fixes #466. Thanks @MarcelCFritsche.

### Fixes

- Flows: swallow best-effort heartbeat write failures at the timer boundary so storage errors do not become unhandled promise rejections. Thanks @SebTardif.

- Runtime/sessions: use collision-resistant temporary paths for concurrent atomic session and index writes. Thanks @henkterharmsel.

- CLI/status: report a normal cold-start session as `agent starting` while preserving `needs reconnect` for an unreachable live owner. Thanks @guettli.

## 2026.7.23 (v0.12.1)

### Changes

- Agents/built-ins: refresh the default Pi, Codex, Claude, and Mux adapter ranges. Thanks @kelvinschen and @TheAngryPit.

### Breaking

### Fixes

- Session queue owner: capture a bounded owner stderr tail and exit status during cold start only (stop retaining at first IPC accept; keep draining the pipe so long-lived owners are not killed by EPIPE) so a dead owner reports the real failure instead of a silent timeout. Thanks @SebTardif.

## 2026.7.4 (v0.12.0)

### Changes

- Agents/built-ins: add Grok Build via `grok agent stdio`, including cached-login and `XAI_API_KEY` authentication selection. Thanks @TheAngryPit.

### Breaking

### Fixes

- CLI/queue: drain active turns before releasing queue-owner leases and preserve typed retryable shutdown responses while terminating agent bridges. Thanks @superWorldSavior.

- CLI/quiet output: emit exactly one structured stderr diagnostic for direct and queued prompt failures without adding diagnostics to stdout. Thanks @superWorldSavior.

## 2026.6.23 (v0.11.2)

### Changes

### Breaking

### Fixes

- Runtime/status: persist token usage reported on successful prompt responses,
  including adapters that only provide a sparse `usage_update`.

## 2026.6.23 (v0.11.1)

### Changes

- Runtime/embedding: preserve per-agent environment variables across ACP session
  creation, queue handoff, persistence, and reconnects. Thanks @zhangguiping-xydt.

### Breaking

### Fixes

- CLI/queue: harden command parsing, queue-owner startup, stale process cleanup,
  and release/CI checks found by `clawpatch`.
- Windows/Claude: only export a native `.exe` as `CLAUDE_CODE_EXECUTABLE`;
  unresolved `.cmd`, `.bat`, and `.ps1` shims now fall back to the Claude ACP
  adapter's bundled native binary. Fixes openclaw/openclaw#93465.
- Client/ACP: ignore non-object JSON lines from adapter stdout before ACP
  dispatch, preventing primitive frames from crashing the SDK message path.
- ACP/models: call the current SDK `session/set_model` method for legacy model
  metadata instead of the generic extension fallback.
- CLI/config: add `--mcp-config` for session-scoped MCP servers without writing
  a project config file. Live persistent sessions reject MCP config changes until
  closed. Fixes #387.

## 2026.6.17 (v0.11.0)

### Changes

- Agents/built-ins: bump the default Claude ACP adapter range to `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp@^0.37.0`. Thanks @trumpyla.
- Runtime/embedding: surface cost, token usage breakdowns, and advertised command metadata on runtime status/events. Thanks @DaniAkash.
- Agents/built-ins: add `fast-agent` as a built-in fast-agent ACP adapter via `uvx fast-agent-mcp acp`.
- Agents/built-ins: add `mux` as a built-in coder/mux ACP adapter via `npx -y mux@^0.27.0 acp`. Thanks @ThomasK33.
- CLI: add `acpx compare` to run one prompt across multiple agents and summarize timing, token usage, stop reason, permissions, and final output side by side. Thanks @mvanhorn.

### Breaking

### Fixes

- Runtime/embedding: export a stable typed error and predicate for requested model
  selectors that an ACP agent does not support, including whether model
  capability is missing or the requested id is unadvertised, so embedders do not
  need to match error text.
- CLI/Claude: isolate built-in Claude ACP sessions from user settings by default so globally enabled channel and daemon plugins cannot interfere with a spawned session. Set `ACPX_CLAUDE_INCLUDE_USER_SETTINGS=1` to restore user settings deliberately. Fixes #361.
- ACP/models: support SDK 0.25 model config options while preserving `session/set_model` compatibility for adapters that explicitly advertise legacy model metadata.
- CLI/Claude: let Claude Code adjudicate model selectors missing from a stale advertised model list on later persistent turns, and preserve the adapter-reported current model after model switches. Thanks @oakif.
- Client/ACP: advertise scoped Devin/Windsurf-compatible client metadata and handle Devin extension requests/notifications without noisy method-not-found logs. Thanks @LivioGama.
- Runtime/sessions: treat corrupt public file-session records as missing while preserving genuine filesystem errors. Thanks @KrasimirKralev.

## 2026.5.23 (v0.10.0)

### Changes

- CLI/sessions: add `sessions export` and `sessions import` for moving portable session archives between machines. Thanks @mvanhorn.

### Breaking

### Fixes

## 2026.5.22 (v0.9.0)

### Changes

- Tooling: add Slophammer TypeScript quality gates for coverage, complexity,
  unsafe types, mutation testing, DRY checks, and dependency boundaries.
- Agents/built-ins: switch the default Codex adapter to `@agentclientprotocol/codex-acp`, with Codex model selection handled through advertised ACP model ids, and bump the default Claude ACP adapter range.
- Tooling: add a repo-local autoreview skill and helper for Codex-first
  closeout review with acpx checks in parallel.

### Breaking

### Fixes

- CLI: treat `--version` after `--` as prompt text instead of intercepting it as a top-level version request.
- CLI: keep custom raw agent commands routed correctly when global flags such as `--system-prompt`, `--append-system-prompt`, `--prompt-retries`, or `--no-terminal` appear before the agent name. Thanks @amknight.
- CLI/API: avoid installing CLI-only process handlers when the package entrypoint is imported as a module.
- CLI/sessions: use agent-side ACP `session/list` when available, including
  cursor pagination, cwd filtering, and agent-native session metadata. Thanks
  @amknight.
- Sessions/reconnect: use ACP `session/resume` when adapters advertise it, so resume-only agents can reuse saved sessions without requiring `session/load`. Thanks @amknight.
- CLI/ACP: validate rich prompt blocks against advertised ACP
  `promptCapabilities` and support audio prompt content end-to-end. Thanks
  @amknight.
- CLI/status: hide stale cached session PIDs when no live helper process exists. Thanks @dutifulbob.

## 2026.5.15 (v0.8.0)

### Changes

- Runtime/embedding: add an optional `onPermissionRequest` callback to `AcpRuntimeOptions` and `AcpClientOptions` so embedders can intercept ACP per-call permission requests with their own UI. Returning a decision short-circuits the mode-based resolver; returning `undefined` falls through to it, leaving CLI behavior unchanged. Thanks @DaniAkash.
- Runtime/embedding: `AcpRuntime.ensureSession` now accepts `sessionOptions` (`systemPrompt`, `model`, `allowedTools`, `maxTurns`) for fresh sessions, threading the values into `_meta.systemPrompt` (and `_meta.claudeCode.options.*`) on the underlying `session/new` request and persisting them onto the new record. Reusing an existing persistent record continues to ignore `sessionOptions` since system prompts are fixed at `newSession` time. `SessionAgentOptions` and `SystemPromptOption` are now re-exported from `acpx/runtime`. Thanks @DaniAkash.
- Runtime/embedding: surface advertised models on `AcpRuntimeStatus.models` so embedders can build model pickers without reaching into private session records. Thanks @DaniAkash.
- CLI/permissions: add `--permission-policy`/`--policy` for per-tool ACP permission rules with `autoApprove`, `autoDeny`, `escalate`, and `defaultAction`; non-interactive escalations now surface structured tool name/input metadata for orchestrators.

### Breaking

### Fixes

- Runtime/embedding: preserve structured ACP `tool_call_update` details on public runtime events, including content, output, locations, kind, and raw payload fields, so embedders can display live tool progress. (#306) Thanks @joeia26.
- CLI/sessions: checkpoint live assistant and tool updates while prompt turns are still running, so `sessions read` and `sessions history` can show in-flight progress instead of only the submitted prompt. (#314) Thanks @AndroidPoet.
- Flows: keep external TypeScript flow modules that import `acpx/flows` compatible with current `tsx` loader behavior.
- Terminal: run no-argument `terminal/create` command lines so agents that send an unsplit command do not fail with `ENOENT`. Thanks @xdjyxu.
- CLI/config: accept command-local `--format` on `config show` and `config init`.
- CLI/sessions: accept the documented `-s` shorthand on `sessions new` and `sessions ensure`.
- Replay viewer: add help output for `pnpm viewer --help` without starting a server.
- Replay viewer: make `pnpm viewer status` and `pnpm viewer stop` dispatch to the requested command instead of always prepending `start`.
- Package: keep `npm pack --json` output parseable by running the prepack build quietly.
- CLI/output: exit cleanly on broken pipes so common pipelines such as `acpx ... | grep -q ...` do not crash with an unhandled `EPIPE`.
- Tooling: document the current Node.js 22.13+ and pnpm 10.33.2 floor.
- Tooling/docs: document npm-based pnpm bootstrap for clean Node 22.13 setups with stale Corepack signing keys.
- Docs/auth: document the supported `authPolicy` values and ACP credential selection behavior.
- Docs/skills: make the quick setup skill-install command noninteractive and route unsupported harnesses to the reference URL.
- CLI/queue: honor per-request `--prompt-retries` when sending a prompt to an already-warm persistent queue owner.
- Runtime/embedding: reject unsupported advertised config option keys before forwarding them to adapters, and map generic `thinking` controls to advertised `effort` options when available. (#293)

## 2026.5.5 (v0.7.0)

### Changes

- Flows/authoring: add `decision()` and `decisionEdge()` helpers for constrained LLM branching on top of the existing `acp`, `parse`, and `switch` machinery. (#278) Thanks @JoshuaLelon.

### Breaking

### Fixes

- Runtime/embedding: preserve normalized ACP `detailCode` values on failed turn results and legacy error events, so embedders can branch on stable error detail codes. (#288) Thanks @kunchenguid.
- Runtime/config: persist advertised `configOptions` from `session/new` and `session/load` and expose their keys through handle-aware runtime capabilities. (#282) Thanks @samithaj.
- CLI/queue: ask active queue owners to send ACP `session/close` before `sessions close` terminates their adapter process. (#283) Thanks @codefromthecrypt.
- CLI/models: fail clearly when `--model` targets a non-Claude ACP agent that does not advertise ACP model support, and reject model ids outside an adapter's advertised `availableModels` instead of silently falling back to the adapter default.
- Windows/Claude: resolve the `claude.exe` executable from PATH before spawning Claude ACP sessions, so native Windows launches do not depend on shell-specific command lookup. (#289) Thanks @MikeChongCan.
- Client/ACP: send `session/close` from `closeSession()` instead of the experimental `nes/close` method, so adapters without NES support can tear down sessions cleanly. (#291) Thanks @hexsprite.
- Runtime/WSL: recognize Windows `.cmd` and `.bat` ACP agent wrappers for cwd translation, including wrappers installed on non-C drives. (#280) Thanks @solomonneas.

## 2026.4.25 (v0.6.0)

### Changes

- CLI/claude: add `--system-prompt <text>` and `--append-system-prompt <text>` global flags that forward through ACP `_meta.systemPrompt` on `session/new`, letting callers replace or append to the Claude Code system prompt without dropping out of persistent acpx sessions. The value is persisted in `session_options.system_prompt` so ensure/reuse flows keep the override. Codex and other agents ignore the field. (#229) Thanks @Vercantez.
- CLI/sessions: add `sessions prune` with `--dry-run`, age filters, and `--include-history` so closed session records and optional event streams can be cleaned up explicitly. (#227) Thanks @coder999999999.
- Runtime/embedding: add `startTurn(...)` turn handles so embedders can observe live runtime events separately from terminal completion, cancel a turn, or close only the event stream while preserving `runTurn(...)` compatibility. (#262) Thanks @enki.
- CLI/ACP: add `--no-terminal` to disable advertised ACP terminal capability for new agent clients. (#155) Thanks @DMQ.
- Agents/built-ins: bump the default `@agentclientprotocol/claude-agent-acp`, `@zed-industries/codex-acp`, and `pi-acp` package ranges so fresh built-in launches pick up the latest adapter releases. (#253, #275) Thanks @flowforgelab.
- Conformance/ACP: add a post-success drain case that catches late tool updates emitted after `session/prompt` resolves. (#252) Thanks @logofet85-ai.
- Docs/session identity: clarify when CLI output shows ACPX runtime session IDs versus backend agent session IDs.
- Dependencies/CI: update ACP SDK, runtime dependencies, TypeScript-native tooling, formatter/lint tooling, and workflow actions.

### Breaking

### Fixes

- CLI/runtime: persist non-mode `session/set_config_option` values and replay them on fresh adapter sessions, so options such as Codex `reasoning_effort` survive session fallback/reuse. (#138)
- CLI/prompt: honor `--model` when sending prompts to existing persistent sessions, including queued owner paths. (#211) Thanks @skywills.
- Runtime/persistent sessions: keep reusable persistent ACP clients warm across turns and close pooled clients during runtime close. (#265) Thanks @Sway-Chan.
- Runtime/ACP: drain late post-success session updates before closing prompt turns so adapters that resolve `session/prompt` before final updates do not drop assistant output. (#251) Thanks @logofet85-ai.
- Runtime/embedding: reuse the saved persistent session when sending runtime controls instead of creating a new backend session for control operations.
- CLI/sessions: persist the submitted prompt at turn start so `sessions history` and `sessions read` no longer report `No history` while an active prompt is already running. (#157)
- Runtime/WSL: translate session cwd with `wslpath` when running under WSL and spawning Windows `.exe` ACP agents, so `session/new` and `session/load` receive paths the agent can access. (#232)
- Client/auth: require explicit `ACPX_AUTH_*` env vars or config `auth` entries for ACP auth-method selection, so ambient provider env like `OPENAI_API_KEY` no longer triggers unintended login flows in adapters such as `codex-acp`.
- Config/agents: honor custom agent `args` arrays from config instead of silently dropping required adapter subcommands. (#199) Thanks @log-li.
- CLI/queue: tighten persistent queue and IPC socket directories to owner-only permissions, including previously-created permissive directories. (#216) Thanks @garagon.
- CLI/queue: use cryptographically random owner generation IDs so rapid queue owner restarts cannot reuse a stale generation token. (#207) Thanks @Yuan-ManX.
- Output/errors: add text-mode remediation hints for auth-required, missing-session, ACP session failures, timeouts, provider rate limits, and invalid model names while keeping JSON error payloads stable. (#256) Thanks @SJeffZhang.
- CLI/quiet output: emit final token usage and cost metadata to stderr when adapters include it in the ACP prompt result, while keeping quiet stdout as assistant text only. (#257)
- CLI/status: report resumable persistent sessions as `idle` when no queue owner is running, instead of marking pre-prompt or TTL-expired sessions as dead. (#185)
- Client/ACP: use the locked ACP SDK close API path so session closing stays compatible with the current SDK.
- Runtime/doctor: guarantee `doctor().details` contains strings even when probe failures include Error or object values. (#267)
- Replay viewer: protect run-bundle file reads from run-id boundary escapes.

- Dependencies: update ACP SDK, workflow actions, TypeScript-native tooling, and development dependencies. (#131, #133, #146, #154, #177)

### Breaking

### Fixes

- Sessions/load: fall back to a fresh ACP session when adapters reject `session/load` with JSON-RPC `-32601` or `-32602`, so persistent session reconnects do not crash on partial load support. (#174) Thanks @Bortlesboat.
- Flows/runtime: finalize interrupted `flow run` bundles as failed instead of leaving them stuck at `running` when the process receives `SIGHUP`, `SIGINT`, or `SIGTERM`. (#188) Thanks @osolmaz.
- Windows/process spawning: enable shell mode for terminal spawn on Windows. (#173) Thanks @Bortlesboat.

- Client/auth: cache derived auth env key lists per auth method to avoid repeated allocations during credential lookup. (#167) Thanks @Yuan-ManX.
- Output/thinking: preserve line breaks in text-mode `[thinking]` output instead of flattening multi-line thought chunks into one line. (#194) Thanks @osolmaz.
- Agents/cursor: recognize Cursor's `Session "..." not found` `session/load` error format so reconnects fall back to `session/new` instead of failing. (#195) Thanks @osolmaz.
- Agents/kiro: use `kiro-cli-chat acp` for the built-in Kiro adapter command to avoid orphan child processes. (#129) Thanks @vokako.

### Breaking

### Fixes

- Codex/session config: treat `thought_level` as a compatibility alias for codex-acp `reasoning_effort` so `acpx codex set thought_level <value>` works on current codex-acp releases. (#127) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Session control/errors: surface actionable `set-mode` and `set` error messages when adapters reject unsupported session control params, and preserve wrapped adapter metadata in those failures. (#123) Thanks @manthan787.
- Sessions/load fallback: suppress recoverable `session/load` error payloads during first-run prompt recovery and keep the session record rotated to the fresh ACP session. (#122) Thanks @lynnzc.
- Permissions/stats: track client permission denials in permission stats. (#120) Thanks @lynnzc.
- Agents/gemini: default to `--acp` for Gemini CLI and fall back to `--experimental-acp` for pre-0.33 releases. (#113) Thanks @imWildCat.
- Images/prompt validation: validate structured image prompt block MIME types and base64 payloads, emit human-readable CLI usage errors, and add an explicit non-CI live Cursor ACP smoke test path. (#110) Thanks @vincentkoc.
- Windows/process spawning: detect PATH-resolved batch wrappers such as `npx` on Windows and enable shell mode only for those commands. (#102) Thanks @lynnzc.
